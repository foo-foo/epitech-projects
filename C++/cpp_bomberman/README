	Welcome in Bombermario


	NOTE:

	I had to realize this project for school with 3 partners.
	Unfortunatly, the qt menu part and the IA part are not well realized.
	So I removed these parts from the Game.

	Now you can only launch the game with the map pokemon (stocked in Game/Maps) and in multiplayer mode.
	I may fix the menu & IA issues when I will have some free time but it's not for now.


	HOW TO:

	To launch the game please move in Game folder an use an LD_PRELOAD command line as below:

	LD_PRELOAD=LibBomberman_linux_x64/libs/libfbxsdk.so ./bomberman




	Enjoy ;)
