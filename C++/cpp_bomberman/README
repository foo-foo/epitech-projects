	Welcome in Bombermario


	NOTE:

	I had to realize this project for school with 3 partners.
	Unfortunatly, the  qt menu part was not well realized.
	I completly removed the QT menu because of compability troubles.
	So it's not possible to choose IA numbers & level anymore or to choose map.
	To play on another map, for the moment you will need to go in Maps folder, find the map you want to play on and rename it "pokemon.bmap"
	
	I know it need to be fix and I will fix this when I will have some freetime but it's not for now.


	HOW TO:

	To launch the game please go to Game folder an use an LD_PRELOAD command line as below:

	LD_PRELOAD=LibBomberman_linux_x64/libs/libfbxsdk.so ./bomberman
	
	if you want to play in multiplayer you need to use

	LD_PRELOAD=LibBomberman_linux_x64/libs/libfbxsdk.so ./bomberman multiplayer=on
	
	
	P1 use ZQSD keys & P2 numeric keyboard arrows.
	
	
	BUGS :
	
	Game may be slow due to 3d models & animations which are very heavy.
	Game may quit suddenly when puting a bomb at same position & time that another player. This one will be fixed with other troubles when I will have some time.


	Enjoy ;)
